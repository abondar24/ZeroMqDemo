## Lazy Pirate Pattern

Simple reliable request-reply pattern 

- lserver - server simulating issues
```yaml
   ./main ls
  ```

  - lclient - reliable client holding reconnection to lserver
  ```yaml
     ./main lc
  ```

## Simple Pirate Pattern
Basic reliable queing for Lazy Pirate

  - rqueue - reliable queue connecting lclient and rworker
  ```yaml
       ./main rq
  ```

  - rworker - reliable worker
  ```yaml
       ./main rw
  ```
## Paranoid Pirate Pattern
Robust reliable queuing

  - rqueue - robust reliable queue with heartbeat connecting lclient and rorworker
  ```yaml
       ./main rrq
  ```

  - rorworker - robust reliable worker
  ```yaml
       ./main rrw
  ```
### [Majordomo Protocol](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:7/MDP/) 
Service oriented reliable pattern
  - mdworker - worker 
  ```yaml
       ./main mdwr <true/false>
  ```
  - mdbroker - broker 
    ```yaml
         ./main mdbr <true/false>
    ```
  - mdclient - client 
     ```yaml
          ./main mdcl <true/false>
     ``` 
    
  - mdsrch - worker search discovery client. requires mdbroker and worker 
       ```yaml
            ./main mdsrch <true/false>
       ``` 
## Titanic
Disconnected reliable pattern based on Majordomo
(there is an issue with async mdapi)
- drbroker - broker 
    ```yaml
         ./main drbr <true/false>
    ```
 - drclient - client 
     ```yaml
          ./main drcl <true/false>
     ``` 
 Required mdbroker and mdworker. Starting sequence: mdworker,mdbroker, drbroker,drclient  
    
  
## Binary Star
Primary/backup high-availability pair

- hsrv - highly-available server. if true is set starts as primary server. 
   ```yaml
      ./main hsrv <true> 
    ``` 
     
- hclt - hiighly-available  client.

Two servers must be run: one in primary mode, another in backup 
Idea - stop primary server and restart it. The servers will change roles.   

## [Freelance Protocol](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:10.)

Brokerless connection between server and client

### Model 1: simple retry and failover

- brlServerFail - brokerless failover server
```yaml
./main bsf <endpoint>
```

- brlClientFail - brokerless failover client
```yaml
./main bcf <endpoint> <endpoint>
```

Run: start serveral servers and put as endpoints param to client servers addresses
### Model 2: send message from client, wait , try another server
- brlMsgServerFail - brokerless failover server receiving messages from client
```yaml
./main bsmf <endpoint>
```

- brlRepClientFail - brokerless failover client sending multiple replies to servers and showing avg roundtrip cost
```yaml
./main bcrf <endpoint> <endpoint>
```
Run: start serveral servers and put as endpoints param to client servers addresses

### Model 3: routing usage

- brlRtServer - brokerless routing server
```yaml
./main bsrtf <port> <true>
```

- brlRtClient - brokerless async routing client showing avg roundtrip cost
```yaml
./main bcrtf
```
Run: start two servers with ports 5555 and 5556 and one client.

## Espresso Pattern

Pub-Sub messages tracing

- pstracing - tracing messages comming from publisher to subscriber via pipe
```yaml
./main pst
```

## Last Value Caching

Model where new subscriber catches missed messages after joining

- ptlPub - publisher sending 1000 topics and one random update per second
```yaml
./main ptp <cacheEnabled=true/false>
```

- ptlSub - subscriber which conencts to one random topic and gets messages
```yaml
./main pts <cacheEnabled=true/false>
```

- lvcProxy - Last value caching proxy for data resending
```yaml
./main lvc 
```

Two subscriber required for demo. Runing order: lvc,pub, more than one sub.

## Suicidal Snail Pattern

Slow subscriber detection

- slowSubDetection - subscirber dies if msg is 1 second late. publisher send messsage with time stamp every msec
```yaml
./main ssd 
```

## Clone Pattern

Reliable Pub-Sub

- relPSServer - server
```yaml
./main rpss <primary=true/false>
```
- relPSClient - client
```yaml
./main rpsc 
```

Run: two servers(one primary,one backup) and two client

- fileTransfer - file transfer via ZeroMQ

```yaml
  ./main ft <filePath>
```
